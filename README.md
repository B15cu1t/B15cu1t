## 🧠 About Me

I’m a student developer interested in low-level understanding of systems —
where Python, networking, and security concepts intersect.

I avoid tutorial-dependence.
I prefer hands-on experimentation, debugging failures, and learning why things work instead of just that they work.

## 🛠️ Current Focus
- Python projects involving networking, threading, and system behavior
- Simple client–server architectures
- Introductory security and ethical hacking concepts

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Python (threading, sockets, clean structure)
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, client–server models)
- Cybersecurity basics and security thinking
