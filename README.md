# 💫 About Me

I’m a student developer focused on **Python**, **networking fundamentals**, and **cybersecurity**.

I learn by **building and breaking real projects** — not by memorizing tutorials or pretending to know things I haven’t implemented yet. I care about understanding *how systems work under the hood*: networking, concurrency, and basic security mechanisms.

### 🔧 What I’m working on
- Python projects involving **networking, threading, and system-level concepts**
- Simple **client–server architectures** and security-related experiments

### 🌱 What I’m learning
- Python beyond the basics (threading, networking, clean structure)
- Core networking concepts (TCP/IP, sockets, client–server models)
- Cybersecurity fundamentals and ethical hacking principles

### 🤝 Open to collaborating on
- Beginner–intermediate **Python** projects
- Small **networking or security tools** with clear learning goals

> I value clarity, simplicity, and learning things the hard way — by making mistakes and fixing them.
