I’m a student developer focused on understanding **how software systems actually work**.

My main interests are **Python**, **networking fundamentals**, and **introductory security concepts**.  
I’m early in the process and intentionally building from the basics instead of skipping ahead.

I learn by writing small programs, breaking them, debugging the failures, and slowly connecting how code, networks, and systems interact.

---

## Focus Areas

- Networking fundamentals: sockets, TCP/IP concepts, client–server communication  
- Concurrency basics: threading, multiprocessing, and where things fail  
- Security fundamentals: defensive thinking, common mistakes, secure coding habits  
- System behavior: observing programs under load, errors, and misuse  

---

## Current Work

- Python projects involving networking and threading  
- Simple client–server applications to understand protocols and data flow  
- Small, controlled experiments to learn how systems break and how to prevent it  

Educational and learning-focused only.

---

## Direction

- Strengthening fundamentals before moving to advanced topics  
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code  
- Understanding systems deeply rather than quickly

> Understanding beats speed.  
> Solid fundamentals scale better than shortcuts.
